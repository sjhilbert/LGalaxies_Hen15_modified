# Welcome to LGalaxies!

This version of the **galaxy evolution code LGalaxies** is based on the PublicRelease version of Henriques et al. (2015).

**Documentation** about the original code can be found here:
- http://galformod.mpa-garching.mpg.de/public/LGalaxies/

There one can also find information about **additional data required** for using the code (e.g. halo tree data or photometric data for filters).

This version **differs** in three main ways from the PublicRelease version:
- The code has been made **easier to read** (in most places).
- The code has been optimized for speed (~3 times **faster** overall).
- Functionality for **lightcone outputs** has been added.

For a more **detailed account of the changes**, please read the [changes.md](changes.md) file.

To report any **issues** or to ask **questions** regarding the code, you may send an email to:
