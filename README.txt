This  version of the galaxy evolution code LGalaxies is based on the PublicRelease version of Henriques et al. Documentation about the original code can be found here:
- http://galformod.mpa-garching.mpg.de/public/LGalaxies/

This version differs in three main ways from the PublicRelease version:
- The code has been made easier to read (in most places).
- The code has been optimized for speed.
- Functionality for lightcone outputs has been added.
